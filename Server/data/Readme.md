# Default game data

This folder contains default game data. It is not imported by default. If you want to have already drawings you can use this data. It can be usefull since some game mode might not be able to start if there are no drawings in the database.

In order to import, you must include the files in the zip archive (`data.zip`) to the datastore folder. Also, you need to import the rows from the `games.sql` file in the database.

The files are also available at those links
